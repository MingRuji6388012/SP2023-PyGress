"""
We construct a representation of cycle_free paths of a fixed length. This fixed 
length will often not be mentioned in what follows.
We call our representation "the cycle_free paths graph". Below it is the 
graph G_cf (actually it is G_cf_pruned but for now it will be convenient to 
ignore this distinction).

G_cf is required to have three  properties.

CF1: Every source-to-target path in G_cf is cycle free.
CF2: Every cycle free path in the original graph appears as a source-to-target path 
     in G_cf.
CF3: There is a 1-1 correspondence between the paths in G_cf and the paths in the 
     original graph. This means there is no redundancy in the representation.
     For every path in the original graph there is a unique path in G_cf that corresponds to it.

These 3 conditions will ensure that we can sample paths in the original graph 
faithfully by sampling paths in G_cf. We can also perform graph theoretic 
operations on G_cf to simulate useful operations on the set of paths in the original graph.

The starting point is the paths graph (pg_raw below) that represents "all" 
paths (cycle free or not) of the given fixed length from source to target.

Then using the previous iterative procedure we prune away junk nodes and more importantly
tag each node with its cycle free history. More precisely if u is in tags[v] then  we are 
guaranteed that every path from u to v that involves only nodes appearing in tags[v] will be 
v-cycle_free. In other the name of v (i.e. v[1]) will not appear in the path. Further, it will also be
u-cycle free. Note however tags[u] may contain node that has the same name as that of v. 
Indeed this the crux of the problem.

Moving on, this path graph 
is named G_0 and the associated tags map is named T_0 below.

G_cf is computed by refining G_0. But first let us consider 
why G_0 is not an ideal representation of the set of cycle free paths of a fixed length.
First, G_0 does not have the property (CF1) (though it does have the properties (CF2) and 
(CF3)). As a result one can't just walk through the graph 
from source to node and generate a cycle free path. Instead one must use a sampling 
method with memory to generate cycle free paths. In particular if one has reached the node u
via the path p and v is a successors of u then one can extend p by moving to v only 
if p is contained in T_0[v]. Thus whether the move along the edge (u,v) is 
conditioned by the memory of how u was reached. Further, one can get stuck while using 
this sampling procedure. Hence it is not clear whether one is sampling the set of 
paths of interest in a faithful fashion. More importantly it is not clear how one can 
perform graph theoretic operations on G_0 to simulate operations on the set of cycle fre paths of 
interest. We will however keep in mind that G_0 together with its path sampling 
procedure is  a useful tool to have around.

Constructing G_cf by refining G_0 may be viwed as synthesizing a memoryless strategy for 
generating cycle free paths. In other words, if (u,v) is an edge in G_cf then no matter how we 
have reached u we must be able to transition to v. A necessary condition that will enable 
this is to ensure that the set of tags of u (T_cf[u]) is included in the set of tags of v (T_cf[v]) 
in G_cf. The challenge is to achieve this while ensuring that the properies (CF1), 
(CF2) and (CF3) are met. 

We explain below the detailed construction of G_cf from this perpective.

def cycle_free_paths_graph(pg, source, target, path_length):
    """Compute a pre cycle free paths graph.
    This is as before. 
    
    Starting from the "raw" (i.e., containing cycles) paths graph, and given a
    target path length n, the algorithm iterates over each "level" in the
    graph 0 <= k <= n where level 0 consists only of the source node and level
    n consists only of the target.
    Each level k consists of a set of nodes, X; we examine each node x in X and
    identify the subset of nodes that are reachable in both the forward and
    backward directions from x. If any of the nodes in the forward reach
    subgraph contain x itself (but at a different depth), this represents a
    cyclic path back through x that is then pruned.
    Each node x therefore defines its own subgraph of cycle free paths, g_x.
    After iterating over all x in X, we combine these subgraphs into the
    (in-progress) cycle free paths graph H_k. H_k therefore consists of the
    superset of nodes of all the subgraphs g_x for level k. When merging these
    subgraphs we prevent the re-introduction of cyclic paths by annotating each
    node in the graph with a list of "tags". The tags for any given node
    consist of a list of nodes lying at prior (upstream) levels. Therefore
    during sampling, transitions from an upstream node to a downstream node are
    only permissible if all nodes in the path up to a certain level are
    contained in the tag set of the downstream node.

Below is the major step (the outer loop) for constructing G_cf. We do so by computing dic_CF, 
a dictionary based version of G_cf.
dic_CF[i] will be a quadruple of the form (V_i, next_i, pred_i, t_i).

V_i will be the set of nodes at level i.

A node -after dic_CF[i] has been computed- will be of the form (i, n, c) where i is the level, n is the name and c is 
the copy number of the node (i,n) in G_0. In other words, each node in G_0 will be split into 
one or more copies to implement our memoryless sampling strategy.

next_i is the successor relation

pred_i[v] is the set of predecessors of of v in V_i. The construction proceeds from 
the target to source. At stage i of the construction we convert nodes of the form (i, n) into 
nodes of the form (i,n,c). For any such new node pred_i[v] will be nodes of the form 
(i-1,n) at level i-1.

t_i[v] will be the new tags of the node v. They will be pairs of the form (j,n).
In other words their type will be the same as of T_0.
(Note: In T_0,  I assign nodes of G_0 as tags rather than their names. This turns out
