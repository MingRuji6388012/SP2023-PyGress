"""
As we know, a paths-graph, say G_n, has the property that every node in G_n
lies on a path of length n from source to target. These paths may not be
cycle-free. Our goal is to transform G_n,  into a new graph G_cf such that in
G_cf every node lies on a cycle-free path from the source to a target. However
it will NOT be the case -despite the misleading name G_cf- that G_cf contains
only cycle-free paths. However we will be able to "easily" sample cycle-free
paths from G_cf without any backtracking. My hope is that without too large a
blow-up, G_cf can be transformed to G_CF which contains only cycle-free paths.
In fact I have a rough idea for doing this but haven't tested it out.

In the present experiment we work with the korkut_im.sif example. We set n = 10
(also equal to max_depth in the get_reachable_sets function).  We will go from
G_10( called pg_raw below) to G_cf in stages. At stage i we process all the
nodes at level i.  We start from G_0  at level 0. The first step is  special in
which obtain G_1 by processing the nodes (0, source) and  (10, target). Then by
processing the the nodes of G_1 at level 1 we will obtain G_2 etc. At the end
of this process we will set G_cf = G_8

The input to the following forward reachset computation will be the graph G_i
at the i-th stage for 1 <= j <= 8 together with one of its nodes at level j.
This forward reach set will be pruned at the next step as explained below.

We also compute the backward version.  We will then attach the pruned forward
reach set to the backward reachset to obtain G_(j+1, v). By patching together
all the graphs in {G_{j+1, v}}_{v in j-th level of G_j} we will obtain G_j.
Remark: The actual names in the code are slightly different. This should be
fixed. Sorry!

forward(v, source, target, G_j) will return the subgraph of G_j, say G_j_v_f,
that is forward reachable from v in G_j.

We prune G_j_v_f through the following iterative procedure.  Let X_j_v be the
set of nodes in G_j_v_f -other than v- that have the same name as v.  In other
words u[1] = v[1] for every u in X_j_v.

The function span(U, src, tgt, g) takes as inputs (a) g the current (possibly
partially pruned) graph (b) U, the set of nodes U that can be pruned.

(i) Remove all the nodes in U.

(ii) Remove all the in_coming and out_going edges (relative to G_j_v_f)  of
these nodes.

(iii) In the resulting graph, identify Y, the set of nodes  have lost all their
in_coming edges or out_going edges.

Return g_prune, the partially pruned graph (obatined through steps (i) and
(ii)) and Y, the candidiate set of nodes for the next iteration of pruning.

prune(Y, src, tgt, g) applies span() repeatedly till there are no more nodes to
be pruned. We call prune() with Y = X_j_v and g = G_j_v_f

In the graph resulting from this pruning process, suppose both v and and tgt
(ie. the node (9, target)) have survived. Since we will be going from lower
levels to higher levels (yes, I can now think forwards!) we are guaranteed to
be able to trace a cycle-free path from (0, source) to v. Further, thanks to
the pruning we are guaranteed to be able to go from v to tgt without hitting a
cycle involving v[1] in the current stage.

If v or tgt gets eliminated then we can conclude that there are no cycle free
paths passing through v in G_j and proceed accordingly.
