"""
As we know, a paths-graph, say G_n, has the property that every node in G_n
lies on a path of length n from source to target. These paths may not be
cycle-free. This module transforms G_n into a new graph G_cf such that in G_cf
every node lies on a cycle-free path from the source to a target. However it
will NOT be the case, despite the misleading name G_cf, that G_cf contains
*only* cycle-free paths. However we will be able to "easily" sample cycle-free
paths from G_cf without any backtracking. Without too large a blow-up, G_cf can
subsequently be transformed to G_CF which contains only cycle-free paths.  In
fact I have a rough idea for doing this but haven't tested it out.

_forward(v, source, target, G_j) will return the subgraph of G_j, say G_j_v_f,
that is forward reachable from v in G_j.

We prune G_j_v_f through the following iterative procedure.  Let X_j_v be the
set of nodes in G_j_v_f -other than v- that have the same name as v.  In other
words u[1] = v[1] for every u in X_j_v.

The function span(U, src, tgt, g) takes as inputs (a) g the current (possibly
partially pruned) graph (b) U, the set of nodes U that can be pruned.

(i) Remove all the nodes in U.

(ii) Remove all the in_coming and out_going edges (relative to G_j_v_f)  of
these nodes.

(iii) In the resulting graph, identify Y, the set of nodes  have lost all their
in_coming edges or out_going edges.

Return g_prune, the partially pruned graph (obtained through steps (i) and
(ii)) and Y, the candidiate set of nodes for the next iteration of pruning.

_prune(Y, src, tgt, g) applies span() repeatedly till there are no more nodes to
be pruned. We call _prune() with Y = X_j_v and g = G_j_v_f

In the graph resulting from this pruning process, suppose both v and and tgt
(ie. the node (9, target)) have survived. Since we will be going from lower
levels to higher levels (yes, I can now think forwards!) we are guaranteed to
be able to trace a cycle-free path from (0, source) to v. Further, thanks to
the pruning we are guaranteed to be able to go from v to tgt without hitting a
cycle involving v[1] in the current stage.

If v or tgt gets eliminated then we can conclude that there are no cycle free
paths passing through v in G_j and proceed accordingly.
