Compute cycle-free paths graphs.

Algorithm developed by P.S. Thiagarajan (https://scholar.harvard.edu/thiagu)

A *paths-graph,* say G_n, has the property that every node in G_n lies on a
path of length n from source to target. These paths may not be cycle-free. This
module transforms G_n into a new graph G_cf such that in G_cf every node lies
on a cycle-free path from the source to a target. Note that it will *not* be
the case, despite the misleading name G_cf, that G_cf contains *only*
cycle-free paths. However, we are able to "easily" sample cycle-free paths from
G_cf without any backtracking using metadata attached to each node in G_cf.

The algorithm is described further in :py:func:`cycle_free_paths_graph`, below.

def cycle_free_paths_graph(pg, source, target, path_length):
    """Compute a cycle free paths graph.

    Starting from the "raw" (contains cycles) paths graph, the algorithm
    proceeds as follows.

    For the purposes of sampling cycle-free paths we attach a set of tags to
    each node when we compute G_j+1 from G_j.  Basically we add the tag v[1] to
    each node in G_j+1 that can be reached from v in the forward direction.
    This tag tells that in tracing path starting from v as long as we stick to
    nodes whose tag set contains v, we will be ok. 

    pg_raw is our path graph. As mentioned above the first step is special. We
    eliminate all cycles involving src as well as all cycles involving tgt. To
    prime the sampling procedure we add the tag 'source' to every node in the
    pruned graph; except to src whose tag set will be []

    Finally we compute each G_j for 1 <= j <= 8 together with tag sets

    We will go from G_n (called pg_raw below) to G_cf in stages. At stage i
    we process all the nodes at level i. We start from G_0 at level 0. The
    first step is special in which obtain G_1 by processing the nodes (0,
    source) and (10, target). Then by processing the the nodes of G_1 at level
    1 we will obtain G_2 etc. At the end of this process we will set G_cf = G_8
